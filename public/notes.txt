Public-static files. that we don't change, like images, or html file. etc. 
src- where we edit and add remove, write code/files. we might delete the default files created by create-react-app in this folder and create our own files. 
package.json- all the dependancies
packaage_lock.json- versions of all the dependancies



Every file is a universe in itself, so we will import whatever we need to reference or use, for eg. libraries like 'react' or other files.
